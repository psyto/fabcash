Internet crackdown? Fabcash works via Bluetooth.

## Additional Posts

### Philosophy

```
Every wallet: "NEVER lose your seed phrase!"
Fabcash: "There is no seed phrase."

github.com/psyto/fabcash

@solana
```

```
Lose phone → lose funds.

Bug? No. Feature.

github.com/psyto/fabcash

@solana
```

```
Privacy > Recovery

github.com/psyto/fabcash

@solana @LightProtocol @PrivacyCash
```

```
Best privacy = nothing to reveal.

github.com/psyto/fabcash

@solana #Privacy
```

### Use Cases

```
For activists. For journalists. For deniability.

github.com/psyto/fabcash

@solana
```

```
"Unlock your wallet"
"Nothing to recover."

github.com/psyto/fabcash

@solana #Privacy
```

### Technical

```
Phones close → Bluetooth → Tx signed → Done.

No internet.

github.com/psyto/fabcash

@solana
```

```
"We encrypt your seed phrase"
vs
"We don't create one"

github.com/psyto/fabcash

@solana
```

### Punchy

```
Fabcash = cash, but @solana

github.com/psyto/fabcash
```

```
True burner wallet. No asterisks.

github.com/psyto/fabcash

@solana
```

```
"I forgot my seed phrase" is intended behavior.

github.com/psyto/fabcash

@solana
```

```
Threat model: governments, not hackers.

github.com/psyto/fabcash

@solana
```

### Solana Mobile

```
Fabcash + @solonamobile

Offline wallet for offline users.

github.com/psyto/fabcash

#SolanaMobile
```

```
No Seed Vault = no proof wallet exists.

github.com/psyto/fabcash

@solonamobile
```
